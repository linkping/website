    <h2>What is a hackerspace?</h2>
    The original meaning of the word 'hack' is to fix something (usually technically) in a creative way. So a hacklab is a place where you create things, fix things and learn about things for the fun of doing so.
    Implicit in the spirit of learning and creating is an openness to teach/share and to learn. <i>It is not necessary to be an expert of any kind in order to be a member.</i> What is necessary is an actual urge to learn and tinker and to do it in a shared space with others.
    <h2>Are there courses or activities? What do you do?</h2>
    If you want a workshop or an activity or a course - feel free to arrange it! Order of the day business is people building projects in the lab and keeping each other company and sometimes helping each other.
